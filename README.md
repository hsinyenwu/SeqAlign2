# SeqAlign2
Shiny app for multiple sequence alignment.
You can input your target sequence. You can use this tool to find if our CRISPR/Cas9 transgenic lines contain mutations. You can also use it to check if your plasmids contain the sequence you want.

You can download the pdf and csv files.  
  * The csv file contains: 
    1. The name of the input file 
    2. Length of DNA sequences used in this analysis
    3. Whether the target sequence is in the DNA sequences
    4. DNA sequences used in the analysis.
  * The pdf file contains the msa plot.
